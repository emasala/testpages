The Joint Effort Group is an activity of the [Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG)](https://vqeg.org) created in 2009 that proposes an alternative collaborative action. Usually, VQEG inspects models performance from individual proponents with respects to jointly developed test plans in a competitive manner.

## Mission
The Joint Effort Group (JEG) is intending to work jointly on both mandatory actions to validate metrics: subjective dataset completion and metrics design. That means that any proposal for improving metrics should be possible to inspect and that it is not necessary to provide a full metric to enter in the process. Therefore, JEG is clearly offering an opportunity to jointly propose quality metrics. In order to maintain fair validation of proposed tool and to avoid precious subjective quality assessment results, the metric has to be designed in a such a way that any contribution is assessed according to the availability of source code to the group. It is also expected to increase after validation for some purposes, to extend the subjective dataset in order to better identify the limitations or extension of application scope of quality metrics. Regarding this latter comment, JEG could produce quality metrics identified through profile/layer with respect of their application scope.

# JEG-Hybrid

The JEG Hybrid Group is an open collaboration working together to develop a robust Hybrid Perceptual/Bit-Stream model. The JEG has developed and made available routines to create and capture bit-stream data and parse bit-streams into HMIX files. Efforts are underway into developing subjectively rated video quality datasets with bit-stream data that can be used by all JEG researchers. The goal is to produce one model that combines metrics developped separately by a variety of researchers. 
Some of the software tools can be found in the [VQEG Tools page](https://vqeg.github.io/software-tools/).

## JEG Resources
JEG is organized around shared resources that are used in research projects at the different JEG members.
Consistency of information is judged to be important. Any questions or remarks are therefore welcome.
The following resources are shared by the JEG members and are explained and/or improved on request.

* Databases (SRC, H.264, HEVC, annotation with objective measurements, questions...)
(Organisation of reproducible research: Virtualbox, HMIX files and tools, MySQL processing database)
* Robust decoder
(, packet error introduction and concealment, restreaming)
* Statistical analysis of objective Full-Reference measures towards understanding which data needs to be subjectively evaluated:  PAPER X Y Z
* ????? Contribution from VQEG-MOAVI / Development of indicators for bitstream analysis / indicators for NR measurements
Combination algorithms for indicators / training / verification / validation including statistical analysis

## Joining JEG
If you are interested in joining JEG, please follow the procedure to join the JEG and JEG-Hybrid mailing list, described here.

* Getting started
Please be aware that VQEG-JEG is a scientific working group. This implies that often results are yet unverified. In many cases, researchers also lack time to document work-in-progress. Please consider this as reason why there is not a lot of written documentation available. We discuss work in progress on our biweekly conference calls and either officially publish the results or update the documentation when our research is stable and validated.
The best way to get started is to join the VQEG reflector and the VQEG-JEG reflector or contact the co-chairs if you have trouble with this

* Contact the co-chairs, write a mail to the reflector or join a conference call
Provide a short introduction of yourself and your research on a conference call (5-10 minutes, slides sent to the JEG reflector beforehand are welcome but not mandatory)
In the following discussion, we will conjointly integrate your research topic and ideas into the currently ongoing JEG research
More detailed calls or mail exchanges will follow naturally
