The Joint Effort Group is an activity of the [Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG)](https://vqeg.org) created in 2009 that proposes an alternative collaborative action. Usually, VQEG inspects models performance from individual proponents with respects to jointly developed test plans in a competitive manner.

## Mission
The Joint Effort Group (JEG) is intending to work jointly on both mandatory actions to validate metrics: subjective dataset completion and metrics design. That means that any proposal for improving metrics should be possible to inspect and that it is not necessary to provide a full metric to enter in the process. Therefore, JEG is clearly offering an opportunity to jointly propose quality metrics. In order to maintain fair validation of proposed tool and to avoid precious subjective quality assessment results, the metric has to be designed in a such a way that any contribution is assessed according to the availability of source code to the group. It is also expected to increase after validation for some purposes, to extend the subjective dataset in order to better identify the limitations or extension of application scope of quality metrics. Regarding this latter comment, JEG could produce quality metrics identified through profile/layer with respect of their application scope.

# JEG-Hybrid

The JEG Hybrid Group is an open collaboration working together to develop a robust Hybrid Perceptual/Bit-Stream model. The JEG has developed and made available routines to create and capture bit-stream data and parse bit-streams into HMIX files. Efforts are underway into developing subjectively rated video quality datasets with bit-stream data that can be used by all JEG researchers. The goal is to produce one model that combines metrics developped separately by a variety of researchers. 
Some of the software tools can be found in the [VQEG Tools page](https://vqeg.github.io/software-tools/).
